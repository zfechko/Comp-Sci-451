**1. Find all distinct parts supplied by Pullman stores. Return “pid”s of those parts**

$\Pi_{\text{pid}} (\text{Catalog} \bowtie \sigma_{\text{city}} = \text{'Pullman'} (\text{Suppliers}))$

**2. Find the suppliers in Pullman who supply a yellow part for less than $11. Return “sid”s
and names for those suppliers**

$$\Pi_{\text{sid, sname}} (\sigma_{\text{city}} = \text{'Pullman'} ∧ \text{color} = \text{'yellow'} ∧ \text{price} < 11 (\text{Parts} \bowtie \text{Suppliers} \bowtie \text{Catalog}))$$

**3.  Find all parts which are provided by some supplier (i.e., they appear in the catalog) but
they were never ordered by a customer. Return the “pid”s and names of those parts.**

$$\Pi_{\text{pid, pname}} (\text{Parts} \bowtie (\Pi_{\text{pid}} (\text{Catalog}) - \Pi_{\text{pid}} (\text{Orders})))
$$

**4. Find all customers who ordered one of the products that Andy ordered. Return names and cities of those customers and the `pid` of the products they ordered**

$$\Pi_{\text{cname, city, pid}} (\text{Customers} \bowtie \text{Orders} \bowtie (\Pi_\text{pid}(\text{Orders}) (\sigma_{\text{cname}} = \text{'Andy'} (\text{Customers}))))$$

**5. Find the suppliers who have received orders from customers who live in the city where that supplier is located. Return `sid`, names, and cities of those suppliers.**

$$\Pi_{\text{sid, sname, city}} (\text{Customers} \bowtie \text{Orders} \bowtie \text{Suppliers})$$

**6. Find customers who ordered more than two items from a single supplier (i.e., the sum of the quantities of all parts the customer purchased from the supplier is at least *3*). Return names of the customers, `sid`s, and the number of items they ordered**
