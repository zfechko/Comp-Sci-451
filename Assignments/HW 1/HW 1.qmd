# Question 1
A chain of pharmacy stores has asked you to design its database. Here's the information that you gather:  

- Patients are identified by their SSN. For each patient, the name, address, and age must be recorded
- Doctors are identified by their SSN. For each doctor, their name, specialty, and years of experience must be recorded
- Each clinic is identified by its name and the city it is in. A clinicâ€™s name is assumed to be unique within the city.
- Doctors work for clinics. Each doctor should be associated with at least one clinic
- Every patient has one primary physician. Every doctor has at least one patient
- Each drug company is identified by name and has a phone number
- For each drug, the name and formula must be recorded. Each drug is made by a given drug company, and the drug name identifies a drug uniquely among the products of that company. If a drug company is deleted, you need not keep track of its products any longer
- Each pharmacy has a unique name and has a phone number. A pharmacy can either be an in-store pharmacy (which has an address) or an online pharmacy (which has a webURL).
- Each pharmacy sells several drugs and has a price for each. A drug could be sold at several pharmacies, and the price could vary from one pharmacy to another.
- Doctors write prescriptions for patients. A doctor can write prescriptions for many patients and a patient could obtain prescriptions from several doctors.
- A doctor could prescribe one or more drugs in a prescription. Each prescription has a prescription number and a date associated with it. Each prescription is given to the patient in a certain clinic and the prescription number is unique within the clinic it is
given
- Drug companies have long-term contracts with in-store pharmacies. A drug company can have contracts with several in-store pharmacies, and an in-store pharmacy can have contracts with several drug companies. For each contract, you have to store a start date, an end date, and the text of the contract
- Pharmacies appoint a supervisor for each contract. There must always be a supervisor for each contract.

## Part A
Draw an ER diagram for the database. Make sure to use the ER notation we covered in the lecture notes.

### Solution

## Part B
How would your design change if each drug must be sold at a fixed price by all pharmacies?

### Solution
If each drug must be sold at a fixed price, then we move the price from the "sells" relationship to the "drug" entity. This is because the price would become an attribute of the drug, and not a part of the relationship between the drug and the pharmacy.

## Part C
Make sure that your diagram is clear and easy to read. Make sure to use the ER notation we covered in the lecture notes.
